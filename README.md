# Thinkful Capstone: Analytic Report And Research Proposal

**Description**

This report is a culmination of the concepts learned in Thinkful's online pre-prep Data Science program.  It is intended to show my aptitude and committment to successfully complete the longer, more challenging full Thinkful Bootcamp.

For my Capstone, I chose to analyze U.S. Net International Investment Position data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  The data used was released on December 28, 2017 and includes end of period annual and quarterly data from 1976 to 2016.
